1 serving oatmeal
1 scoop chocolate protein powder
1 tablespoon peanut-butter

2. Place the cooked oatmeal into a ceral bowl or serving bowl and add the scoop of protein powder and tablespoon of peanut-butter.
3. Stir and mix all the ingredients together in the bowl until a smooth consistency is obtained.

Optional:
Try different flavours of protein powder (though chocolate works best).
Add berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, or whatever is in season).
Milk is not required but if the consistency is too thick add a small amount of milk.
Add spices for variety or seasonal occasions, i.e. a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove gives a festive taste.
